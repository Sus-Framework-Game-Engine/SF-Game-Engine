# NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT COMPLETE.


# Game-Engine
"Abandon all hope, ye who debug here." - Me.

This is the repository of the infamous "Scuffed Framework Game Engine" –> an open-source, attrocious performance, and highly restrictive abomination built on Vulkan.

What I am going for:
- built from the Acid thing but added access to Vulkan 1.3+ features.
- Runs on Windows, maybe Linux in the future, macOS support is never being added becasue fuck you apple gamers.
- fully customizable rendering pipeline to enable deep control over like 2 aspects of the graphics rendering, including shaders, pipelines, and full screen effects.
- not so nodular architecture because I am too lazy.
- optimized for my PC because and my rtx 30 shitty I mean 50.
- Horrible Documentatino: read what is there, do not complain.
I will keep developing this until my expectations are met. And then I will fix everything and finally provide an editor.

If your name is [REDACTED], GO Bis(2-Cloroethyl) sulfide YOURSELF!

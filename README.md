This is the repository of the infamous "Suspicous Framework?" – an open-source, attrocious performance, and highly restrictive thing built on Vulkan.

What we are going for:
Vulkan-Based Rendering: built from the Acid thing but added access to Vulkan 1.3+ features.
Cross-Platform Support: Runs on Windows, maybe Linux in the future, macOS support is never being added becasue fuck you apple gamers.
Customizable Pipeline: fully customizable rendering pipeline to enable deep control over like 2 aspects of the graphics rendering, including shaders, pipelines, and full screen effects.
Extensible: not so nodular architecture because I am too lazy.
Optimized Performance: optimized for my PC because I dont care about you (yet).
Horrible Documentatino: read what is there, do not complain.
I will keep developing this until my expectations are met. And then I will fix everything and finally provide an editor.

If your name is C0Florent, vaxerski, or Declan Connoly, GO FUCK YOURSELF!
And last of all, FUCK YOU vaxerski, YOU CHECKED ONE SOURCE, AND IT WAS WRONG. EVERY OTHER SOURCE SAID IT IS NOT J'REMUE IT IS JE REMUE. ASK ANYONE FRENCH. I ASKED MY LOCAL FRENCH BAKER, HE AND HIS WIFE SAID JE REMUE. KILL YOURSELF.
